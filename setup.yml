# CodePipeline requires an S3 bucket to store artifacts. We will create this bucket
# outside of our main CloudFormation template because CloudFormation is unable to delete
# S3 buckets unless they're empty. This becomes an inconvenience during development,
# because you would have to delete the S3 bucket manually every time you tear down
# your CloudFormation stack. So resources such as these will be put in this separate
# CloudFormation template.
